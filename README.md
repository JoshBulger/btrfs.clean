btrfs.clean
===========
Still under development until I can find more time to add command line arguments and some basic math stuffs (easily accomplished once I have the time).

Intended to clean up excessive snapshots created by fs-snapshot utility; can be used as you see fit

suggested placement is /usr/sbin/
